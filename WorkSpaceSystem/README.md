Project title: Workspace System
About the Project and Overview:
The Workspace Management System is a Java-based application crafted to streamline 
Workspace operations. Connecting to a SQL database, the system offers a user-friendly 
interface for efficient management of items (books, magazines, CDs) and users (students, 
professors, staff, visitors). Built with a focus on input validation, exception handling, and 
object-oriented principles, the project ensures data integrity, scalability, and a reliable 
user experience, revolutionizing library management.
